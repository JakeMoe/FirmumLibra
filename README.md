## Firmum Libra

This is my first attempt at making a modpack. I'm using this project as a learning tool about how modpacks are created and structured.

"Firmum Libra" is Latin for "Stable Balance"; the pack is focused on those two, but also tries to bring some variety.

The actual modpack download can be found on CurseForge here: <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/firmum-libra">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/firmum-libra</a>
